  ## Description
   The app was created so that developers can both publish blog posts, and comment on other posts. The app follows an MVC style structure and    uses Handlebars.js as a template engine. It will use Sequelize as the ORM. Once logged in on the app, users (developers) of this app are      able to read and comment on blog posts. Users (developers) authentication for the app will use the Express-Session npm.
  ## Installation

   Second: After dependencies are installed, user must create the .env file. The .env file must include mySQL: database name, user, and          password.
