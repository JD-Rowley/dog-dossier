  ## Description
  The Dog Dossier is a website that allows owners of dogs to share information and consume information about different breeds of dogs they may be interested in or already own. This app comes loaded with information about certain breeds of dogs including general height and weight, as well as health concerns, and personality traits. Users can sign in and post messages paired with specific breeds in order to exchange information with each other. They can also search for specific breeds via a dropdown menu and add new breeds with information if they desire.
  ## Installation
  Any users looking to make changes and test this code should run the command 'npm i' in their CLI to install all dependencies and then enter the command 'npm start' to start the server. They can also seed the database using the command 'npm run seed.'
  ## Usage
  As mentioned above, the repo comes with seeded data and can be entered into the database easily by entering the command 'npm run seed.'
  ## Contribution Guidelines
  No contributions are being accepted at this time.
  ## Testing
  Testing is done by running the server locally. 'npm start' is the command to start the server, then the user must navigate to the correct localhost port, usually 3001.
